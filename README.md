Basic Responsive Menu Wrapper

Strictly no bells and whistles script which generates a 3 line menu button and assigns click events to open/close a targeted menu.

CSS is very basic, which means you will have to include the css and the corresponding media query css.

The script takes the following options:

mobileWrapperId : 'sfm-wrapper' => Button wrapper id
mobileBtnId : 'sfm-btn',        => Button Id
align : 'right',                => alignment of button (left, center, right)
breakpoint : 767,               => Show the button at this viewport width
duration : 500,                 => open/close menu speed
